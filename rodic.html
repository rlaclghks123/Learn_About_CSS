                <h2>Rodić Davidson: London Architecture</h2>
                <p>
                    Our Bloomsbury based practice has been working in central London since 2006. Having worked within
                    the oldest areas of London, we have developed an expertise in historic buildings. These are often
                    Listed and situated within a Conservation Area. Our knowledge and experience consistently secure
                    Planning Consents, Listed Building Consents and Great Estate Licenses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many areas within central London boroughs were originally developed by aristocratic families
                    (examples being Grosvenor, Cadogan, De Walden, Portman and Bedford), and these family estates still
                    own large swathes of, what is now commonly referred to as, Prime Central London. These Great Estates
                    maintain significant influence either through direct ownership or through various stewardship
                    schemes, an example being the Belgrave Estate Management Scheme administered by Grosvenor. Schemes
                    such as this enable the Estate to exert control over the use, development, and appearance of the
                    designated area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have a growing body of new-build work in Prime Central London and elsewhere the UK. Through
                    sensitive, contextual design and iterative dialogue with Clients and Planners, Rodić Davidson have
                    established a track record of obtaining difficult planning consents for both new-build and existing
                    properties.
