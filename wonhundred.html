          <h1>THE DEADSTOCK BAGS</h1>
          <p>
            Our new denim bags are made of deadstock fabric and offer a new lease of life to
            otherwise discarded fabric. Won Hundred stands by the promise of continually striving to
            produce ethically & responsibly. Instead of starting over, we keep going.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every year, tons and tons of fabric are being discarded, and never used. We, at Won
            Hundred, want to diminish the waste by making some of our styles using these “Dead
            stock” fabrics. Right now, we already have our Won Hundred – Division collab made on
            dead stock from exclusive Italian deadstock fabric and our Dead stock tote bags. We are
            also looking to expand this production to a whole collection in the future
